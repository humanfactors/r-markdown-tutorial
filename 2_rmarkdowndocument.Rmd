## Text formatting
**Paragraphs** begin and end 
with empty lines, and are *not* indented.

- **bold** and *emphasis*
- ~~strikeout~~
- super^scripts^ and sub~scripts~
- and `inline_code($fixed.width)`

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r}
2*2
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```



### Metadata section

The metadata section (YAML header) in an R Markdown script defines how it will be processed and rendered. The metadata section also includes both title, author, and date information as well as options for customizing the output format. For instance, PDF and HTML output can be defined with `pdf_document` and `html_document`, respectively.

### R code chunks

R Code Chunks can be embedded in an R Markdown script by using three backticks
at the beginning of a new line along with arguments enclosed in curly braces
controlling the behavior of the code. The following lines contain the
plain R code. A code chunk is terminated by a new line starting with three backticks.
The following shows an example of such a code chunk. Note the backslashes are
not part of it. They have been added to print the code chunk syntax in this document.

```
	```\{r code_chunk_name, eval=FALSE\}
	x <- 1:10
	```
```

The following lists the most important arguments to control the behavior of R code chunks:

+ `r`: specifies language for code chunk, here R
+ `chode_chunk_name`: name of code chunk; this name needs to be unique
+ `eval`: if assigned `TRUE` the code will be evaluated
+ `warning`: if assigned `FALSE` warnings will not be shown
+ `message`: if assigned `FALSE` messages will not be shown
+ `cache`: if assigned `TRUE` results will be cached to reuse in future rendering instances
+ `fig.height`: allows to specify height of figures in inches
+ `fig.width`: allows to specify width of figures in inches

For more details on code chunk options see [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).

### Inline R code

To evaluate R code inline, one can enclose an R expression with a single back-tick
followed by `r` and then the actual expression.  For instance, the back-ticked version 
of 'r 1 + 1' evaluates to `r 1 + 1` and 'r pi' evaluates to `r pi`.

### Learning Markdown

The basic syntax of Markdown and derivatives like kramdown is extremely easy to learn. Rather
than providing another introduction on this topic, here are some useful sites for learning Markdown:

+ [Markdown Intro on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
+ [Markdown Cheet Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
+ [Markdown Basics from RStudio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) 
+ [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

## Including Plots

Plots generated by the R code chunks in an R Markdown document can be automatically 
inserted in the output file. The size of the figure can be controlled with the `fig.height`
and `fig.width` arguments.

To embed plots, for example:

```{r some_jitter_plot, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
dsmall <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
ggplot(dsmall, aes(color, price/carat)) + geom_jitter(alpha = I(1 / 2), aes(color=color))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### Tables

There are several ways to render tables. First, they can be printed within the R code chunks. Second, 
much nicer formatted tables can be generated with the functions `kable`, `pander` or `xtable`. The following
example uses `kable` from the `knitr` package.

```{r kable}
library(knitr)
kable(iris[1:12,])
```
