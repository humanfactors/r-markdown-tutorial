```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r data, include=T}
# Setting up some fake data for analysis
responsetimes <- rnorm(400, mean = 600, sd = 120)
age <- sample(19:90, 40, replace=T)
gender <- sample(letters[c(6,13)], 40, TRUE)
```

## Simple Inline Analysis

Evaluate `r 2*2` 

The average age of the participants was `r round(mean(age), 2)`, and `r length(which(gender == "m"))` were male while `r round(length(which(gender == "f")),2)` were female. The median response time was `r round(median(responsetimes),3)` and the average response time was `r mean(responsetimes)`.

We could also evaluate other expressions, like multiple 6 by 66 `r 6*66`, or even get pi `r pi`.

<!-- Now have a go at getting the minimum, maximum of ages. -->
