## Introduction to R Notebooks
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

## Our Example: Chopstick Length
What is the optimum length of chopsticks usable by adults? We will be using the "optimum length of chopsticks" data set where researchers set out to determine the optimal length of chopsticks for children and adults. They came up with a measure of how effective a pair of chopsticks performed, called the "Food Pinching Performance." The "Food Pinching Performance" was determined by counting the number of peanuts picked and placed in a cup (PPPC).

## Understanding the Data

First, let's take a look at the descriptive statistics of our chopstick data, as you did above, 

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(psych)
library(ggplot2)
# Load the chopstick data
chopstickdata <- read.csv("data/chopstickdata.csv")
# Also get it in wide form for later use
chopstickdata.wide <- dcast(chopstickdata, Subject ~ ChopstickLength, value.var="FoodPinchingEff")

# Get the descriptives for each ChopstickLength. The [1:6,] just cuts off unused variables.
csdescriptives <- describeBy(chopstickdata, group = chopstickdata$ChopstickLength, mat = T)[1:6,]
# Get the variables we are interested in
csdescriptives <- csdescriptives[,c("group1",	"n",	"mean",	"sd",	"range")]
csdescriptives
```

### Plot of Differences

```{r}
ggplot(data = chopstickdata,
       aes(as.factor(ChopstickLength),FoodPinchingEff)) +
geom_boxplot(aes(color=as.factor(ChopstickLength))) + theme(legend.title=element_blank()) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha=0.2)

```

### T-tests
Now imagine you own a Japanese restarunt and have a choice between chopsticks of 240mm, 270mm or 300mm. How do you determine which you should buy?

```{r}
t.test(chopstickdata.wide$`240`, chopstickdata.wide$`270`, paired=T)
t.test(chopstickdata.wide$`240`, chopstickdata.wide$`300`, paired=T)
t.test(chopstickdata.wide$`270`, chopstickdata.wide$`300`, paired=T)
```
